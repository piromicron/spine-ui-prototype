Spine is a tool to aid in backbone disorder diagnostics based on location of predefined points on X-Ray image. 

This repository contains the prototype of Spine user interface.

Implemented:
 - user can select and load local image into view 
 - Spine puts marks on top of the image from template (expecting frontal left-to-right oriented image)
 - user can move marks to appropriate places - either mouse and touchscreen supported
